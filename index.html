		<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is 
		a 20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. 
		The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and 
		fielding side tries to prevent this and dismiss each player (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include
		being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball 
		after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground. When ten players have been dismissed, the innings ends
		and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee 
		in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record 
		the match's statistical information.</p>
		
		<p>Historically, cricket's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England
		in the middle of the 16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire,
		leading to the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body
		is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members 
		who play Test matches. The game's rules are held in a code called the Laws of Cricket which is owned and 
		maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in the 
		Indian subcontinent, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies, 
		its globalisation occurring during the expansion of the British Empire and remaining popular into the
		21st century. Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved 
		international standard. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won 
		seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been
		the top-rated Test side more than any other country</p>
		
		<h2>A brief history of Cricket</h2>
		
		<p>Having originated in south-east England, it became the country’s national sport in the 18th century
		and has developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since 1844 
		and Test cricket began, retrospectively recognized, in 1877.</p>
		
		<p>The origins of cricket lie somewhere in the Dark Ages – probably after the Roman Empire, almost certainly
		before the Normans invaded England, and almost certainly somewhere in Northern Europe. All research concedes 
		that the game derived from a very old, widespread and uncomplicated pastime by which one player served up 
		an object, be it a small piece of wood or a ball, and another hit it with a suitably fashioned club.</p>
		
		<p>How and when this club-ball game developed into one where the hitter defended a target against the thrower 
		is simply not known. Nor is there any evidence as to when points were awarded dependent upon how far 
		the hitter was able to despatch the missile; nor when helpers joined the two-player contest, thus beginning the 
		evolution into a team game; nor when the defining concept of placing wickets at either end of the pitch 
		was	adopted.</p>
		
		<p>Etymological scholarship has variously placed the game in the Celtic, Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Dutch and 
		Norman-French traditions; sociological historians have variously attributed its medieval development 
		to high-born country landowners, émigré Flemish cloth-workers, shepherds on the close-cropped down land of 
		south-east England and the close-knit communities of iron- and glass-workers deep in the Kentish Weald. 
		Most of these theories have a solid academic basis, but none is backed with enough evidence to establish 
		a watertight case. The research goes on.</p>
		
		<p>What is agreed is that by Tudor times cricket had evolved far enough from club-ball to be recognizable 
		as the game played today; that it was well established in many parts of Kent, Sussex and Surrey; 
		that within a few years it had become a feature of leisure time at a significant number of schools; 
		and – a sure sign of the wide acceptance of any game – that it had become popular enough among young men 
		to earn the disapproval of local magistrates.</p>
		
		<h2>Formats of Cricket</h2>
		<p>1.	Test Match (5 Days consecutive 12 hours match with breaks, officially recognized test match 
		was played in 1877)</p>
		
		<p>2.	ODI’s (One Day International for approximate 8 hours, played in 1971)</p>
		
		<p>3.	T20 (a fast match last for 3 hours, internationally introduced in 2005)</p>

		<p>Cricket is a dynamic, exciting, challenging and most importantly FUN ‘bat and ball’ team sport 
		that is perfect for children and adults of both genders. It is a non-contact sport that can be played indoors
		or outdoors, for short periods of time or for days on end. The sport is accessible to players
		of all levels of ability and fitness, and significantly improves participants levels of physical fitness
		and stamina; hand-eye co-ordination; mental fitness, agility, and tactical awareness; as well as the
		social abilities to work as a significant individual within partnership and team contexts. 
		All of these benefits, and more, make cricket an exceptional sport for all members of the all communities.</p>
