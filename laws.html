		<p>In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket 
		(hereinafter called "the Laws") which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written with a capital "L").
		The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned 
		and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.</p>
		
		<h2>Playing Area</h2>
		<div class = "field">
		<img src="assets/images/cricket_field.jpg"  alt="Cricket Field"></div>
		
		<p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field between two teams of eleven players each. 
		The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, 
		which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; 
		the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.</p>

		<p>In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch on which a wooden target 
		called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart. The pitch is 
		a flat surface 3 metres (9.8 ft.) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the
		game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of 
		three wooden stumps topped by two bails.</p>
		
		<div class = "pitch"><img src="assets/images/cricket_pitch.jpg"  alt="Cricket Pitch"></div>
		
		<p>As illustrated above, the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines: a bowling crease,
		a popping crease and two return creases. The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, 
		which is eight feet eight inches long. The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease
		and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the wicket), 
		it is, in fact, unlimited in length. The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease 
		so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line,
		so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also, in fact, unlimited in length.</p>
		
		<h2>Basic gameplay: bowler to batsman</h2>
		<p>During normal play, thirteen players and two umpires are on the field. Two of the players are batsmen
		and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team. The other nine players in the batting team are
		off the field in the pavilion. The image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being
		bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch.</p>
		
		<div class = "gameplay"><img src="assets/images/gameplay.jpg"  alt="Gameplay"></div>

		<p>In the photo, the two batsmen (3 & 8; wearing yellow) have taken position at each end of the pitch (6).
		Three members of the fielding team (4, 10 & 11; wearing dark blue) are in shot. One of the two umpires 
		(1; wearing white hat) is stationed behind the wicket (2) at the bowler's (4) end of the pitch. 
		The bowler (4) is bowling the ball (5) from his end of the pitch to the batsman (8) at the other end 
		who is called the "striker". The other batsman (3) at the bowling end is called the "non-striker".
		The wicket-keeper (10), who is a specialist, is positioned behind the striker's wicket (9) and behind him 
		stands one of the fielders in a position called "first slip" (11). While the bowler and the first slip are
		wearing conventional kit only, the two batsmen and the wicket-keeper are wearing protective gear including
		safety helmets, padded gloves and leg guards (pads).</p>
		
		<p>While the umpire (1) in shot stands at the bowler's end of the pitch, his colleague stands in the outfield,
		usually in or near the fielding position called "square leg", so that he is in line with the popping crease 
		(7) at the striker's end of the pitch. The bowling crease (not numbered) is the one on which the wicket is 
		located between the return creases (12). The bowler (4) intends to hit the wicket (9) with the ball (5) or,
		at least, to prevent the striker (8) from scoring runs. The striker (8) intends, by using his bat, to 
		defend his wicket and, if possible, to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs.</p>

		<p>Some players are skilled in both batting and bowling, or as either or these as well as wicket-keeping, 
		so are termed all-rounders. Bowlers are classified according to their style, generally as fast bowlers, 
		seam bowlers or spinners. Batsmen are classified according to whether they are right-handed or left-handed.</p>
		
		<h2>Fielding</h2>
		<p>Of the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above. The other eight are elsewhere on the field, 
		their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler. Fielders often change position
		between deliveries, again as directed by the captain or bowler.</p>

		<div class = "fielding"><img src="assets/images/fielding.jpg"  alt="Fielding"></div>

		<p>If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him, 
		but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain, except in the case of concussion substitutes in 
		international cricket.</p>

		<p>The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return.[76] The Laws of Cricket
		were updated in 2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers.</p>
		
		<h2>Innings</h2>
		<p>The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play 
		during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings. 
		Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can
		end before they have all done so. The innings terminates if the batting team is "all out", a term defined by 
		the Laws: "at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman, further balls remain to be bowled 
		but no further batsman is available to come in".</p>
		
		<p>In this situation, one of the batsmen has not been dismissed and is termed not out; this is because 
		he has no partners left and there must always be two active batsmen while the innings is in progress.</p>
		
		<p>An innings may end early while there are still two not out batsmen:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the batting team's captain may declare the innings closed even though some of his players have
			not had a turn to bat: this is a tactical decision by the captain, usually because he believes his 
			team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings</li>
			<li>the set number of overs (i.e., in a limited overs match) have been bowled</li>
			<li>the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time</li>
			<li>in the final innings of the match, the batting side has reached its target and won the game.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Overs</h2>
		<p>The Laws state that, throughout an innings, "the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in
		overs of 6 balls". The name "over" came about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls have been 
		bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends 
		while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does)
		bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a "spell". 
		The batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the 
		striker and vice-versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at "square leg" now 
		stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice-versa.</p>
		
		<h2>Umpires</h2>
		<p>The game on the field is regulated by the two umpires, one of whom stands behind the wicket at 
		the bowler's end, the other in a position called "square leg" which is about 15â€“20 metres away from 
		the batsman on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard. 
		The umpires have several responsibilities including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled
		(i.e., not a no-ball or a wide); when a run is scored; whether a batsman is out 
		(the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase "How's that?" or "Owzat?"); 
		when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game. 
		The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger
		the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.</p>
		
		<p>Off the field in televised matches, there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on 
		certain incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing 
		conditions for Test and Limited Overs International matches played between two ICC full member countries. 
		These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit
		of the game.</p>
		
		<h2>Spirit of the Game</h2>
		<p>Besides observing the Laws, cricketers must respect the "Spirit of Cricket," which is the 
		"Preamble to the Laws," first published in the 2000 code, and updated in 2017, and now opens 
		with this statement:</p>
		
		<p>"Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played 
		not only according to the Laws, but also within the Spirit of Cricket".</p>
		
		<p>The Preamble is a short statement that emphasises the "Positive behaviours that make cricket 
		an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship, and teamwork."</p>
		
		<p>The major responsibility for ensuring fair play is placed firmly on the captains, but extends 
		to all players, umpires, teachers, coaches, and parents involved.</p>
		
		<p>The umpires are the sole judges of fair and unfair play. They are required under the Laws to
		intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player.</p>
