		<p>The International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, is the global governing
		body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, 
		Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965 and took up its 
		current name in 1989. The ICC in 2017 has 105 member nations, twelve of which hold full membership and 
		can play Test cricket. The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major 
		international tournaments, notably the men's and women's versions of the Cricket World Cup. It also 
		appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, Limited Overs 
		Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.</p>
		
		<p>Each member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country, 
		selects the national squad, and organises home and away tours for the national team. In the West Indies, 
		which for cricket purposes is a federation of nations, these matters are addressed by Cricket West Indies.</p>
