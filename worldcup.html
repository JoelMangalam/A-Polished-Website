		<p>The ICC Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. 
		The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), 
		every four years, with first qualification rounds leading up to a semi-finals and then finals tournament. 
		The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the "flagship event of 
		the international cricket calendar" by the ICC.</p>

		<p>The first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having 
		been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years
		before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held 
		as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and
		South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting 
		has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having 
		hosted at least one match in the tournament.</p>
		
		<p>The World Cup is open to all members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), although the 
		highest-ranking teams receive automatic qualification. The remaining teams are determined via the
		World Cricket League and the ICC World Cup Qualifier. A total of twenty teams have competed in 
		the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen teams competing in 2015; the recent 2019 tournament
		only had ten teams. Australia has won the tournament five times, India and West Indies twice each, while
		Pakistan, Sri Lanka and England have won it once each. The best performance by a non-full-member team
		came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament.</p>
